# Search Training (Learn training)
During training, instead of focus on indexing and broadly 'learning', it should prioritize pattern matching and while training should recognize 'the gems'; i.e. the most unique and most deviatory things should be investigated and even reasoned about in order to learn while training and make new connections between the learned information and data. So have a generative capacity while training instead of only after training.

## Example
When indexing all open source code repositories, it should recognize which repo's are unique in subtle ways. Or investigate relatively small ideas that deviate from the average. Like this very repo could become recognized as an outlier because it's **not code but only readmes describing AI concepts**.
