# Sources and their value descriptions

## Wikipedia
Wikipedia cited sources should be thoroughly examined, and determined what biases these sources might have. If there are many source links, but all are from the same source, it should increase their bias significantly.
The source media should be examined for their contents, does the content reflect a reliable source for what reasons? Are they an authority; and on what subjects? Does the source media contain reasoning for their conclusions or logic, or are they themselves sourcing from something else? i.e. is the source reasoning, scientific, or opinion, or emotion?

## Twitter
Source for sources, should not be used for knowledge, but rather for opinion about sources


## Reddit
Mainly a source for argumentation and how not to argue, source for opinions and hot takes. Should never be a reliable source for knowledge, but rather a trainingset for analyzing argumentation and opinion shaping.
