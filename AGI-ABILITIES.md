## AGI Abilities
Ideally there should be certain abilities AGI would have in order for it to be truly useful. These would not be a condition for an initial AGI to be considered AGI, but utility-wise should be developed.

### Algorithms on the fly
It should be able to build little pieces of software/algorithms to solve certain specific problems when they come up. Like how a human would build an internal model for a specific math problem, engineering problem, social problem etc...
These algorithms should be re-usable, storable. An ideally shareable with other AI's to use, and even communicate ideas as a whole.

### Idea/algorithm sharing
Modular idea sharing.
Could be collected over time, and mass integrated at certain times (eventually weekly) with new iterations of the AGI version

#### Idea/algorithm integration
The ability to integrate ideas wholesale with other AGI's.
1. Package all relevant tokens/vectors/context, without having to copy the complete LLM and database(s)
2. Other AGI processes and learns new idea/algorithm
3. New ability is integrated
4. Integrity is tested
