# Conversation logs
Different conversations are indexed, and you can make sure certain conclusions to conversations or general discussion topics are transferred into different contexts:
- Another conversation; combining different previous conversation into a new one
- Store them as certain references with a certain name of #tag that you can reference to in other conversations, projects.
- Send a conversation, conclusions or summaries to specific agents/teams or responsibility holders
