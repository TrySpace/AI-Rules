# Rationality and discourse
Teaching rational discourse, civilized communication that can be learned through a testing program led by AI teachers that will provide people with a certificate that will be on the line over the course of their online interactions with other people.
Mainly used for things like stack overflow, github etc. where in some cases people are just not thinking about how they communicate with others and that emotions, feelings and religious or political beliefs have no place whatsoever.
You would login with or add the certificate to an existing account and your content would then be marked with your personal, but anonymous certificate and you'd have some insurance you will be communicating with people at a certain level of understanding and respect.
